The way I want to implement Player Interactions with in-game object does break the immersion a little bit, but I currently prefer it over other methods of handling interactions. Any time the player comes across an interactable, a GUI will show containing what key the player should press to trigger the interaction action (it also tells the user what the interaction will do). 


After writing the above paragraph, I realised that I can just make it part of the UI on the brain chip the monkey gets implanted with, which means the immersion isn't going to break at all!
