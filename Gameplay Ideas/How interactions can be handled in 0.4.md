## Option 1: The Valve Approach
In modern Valve games, the key-bind for how to perform an action only appears the first time you encounter the interactable object in the game, and then never appears again, as the game assumed player would already know how to perform the action.

## Option 2: How most games do it (Probably what will happen)

Breaks the immersion a little bit, but I currently prefer it. Any time the player comes across an interactable, the popup on what key to press and what the associated action will do will display. Probably will be what I will go for, as it clears up some confusion on the end of some players, and most others don't really mind it (I am one of these people)
