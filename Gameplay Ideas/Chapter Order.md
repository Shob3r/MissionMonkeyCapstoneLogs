This won't really be important for the capstone project, but it's probably a good idea to brainstorm the order of each planet (or chapter) for the game.

the current order is the following:

1. Space station (Ch1)
2. The Moon (Ch1: Interlude)
3. Earth (Ch2)
4. Venus (Ch3)
5. Mercury (Ch4)
6. Mars (Ch5)
8. Asteroid Belt/Ceres (Ch5: Interlude)
9. Jupiter (Ch6)
10. Saturn (Ch7)
11. Uranus (Ch8)
12. Neptune (Ch9)
13. Pluto (Ch10)
14. Weywot (Moon of dwarf planet 50000 Quaoar) (Epilogue)
