Chapter 1 takes place on a massive research lab space station orbiting the moon (it is oriented in a way where there is a top and bottom to the space station). The monkey will wake up at the top of the space station, and work their way downwards through waves of enemies and many puzzles and environmental hazards to get to the bottom of the ship, where they will fight the [final boss]([[Chapter 1 - Final Boss]]) of the chapter.

- Going downwards should be treated as a somewhat big accomplishment (maybe by having some health and a dialogue bit from someone or something, etc (still working this out))
- Getting to lower sectors of the space station will usually be done with stairs or ladders, but may also be done with ramps or accessing the next area through [microgravity]([[Chapter 1 - Microgravity]])
- Maybe the player can solve a puzzle to open up the stairway to the next section?
