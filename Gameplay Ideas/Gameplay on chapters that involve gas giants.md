Quite literally impossible to land on gas. We all know that. Here is what I have come up with for each chapter:
## Jupiter
Power from the sun is being processed and sent onwards at Europa. The monkey will spend most of the time on Europa, diving deep under the crust to access the power generator. (basically, the water level)

## Saturn
Rather than one massive collection station on this planet, there are several substations located around the rings of the planet. The monkey will have to go between them and disable each substation to move onwards

## Uranus 
Thanks to a technology invented before the events of the game, the wind speed of about 900km/h has slowed to something much more tolerable, and a large settlement has formed, floating above the planet. After beginning power harvesting for the time travel technology, the company built a massive collection station in the heart of the flying city

## Neptune 
I have no clue at the moment
