# Welcome to log 1.5

It's been a whole 1 day since I wrote my previous log, but I have found my solution to my task organization problem! What am I using to keep track of every task? the answer is.....
# Trello

Holy hell I have used Trello before and didn't really like it, but this is truly an eye-opening experience for me. I don't know what happened but i feel like i can actually write out my ideas on there. It truly is a miracle. From now On, I will aim to do one or two tasks per day, if the tasks are smaller. If the tasks are much larger and take more time, I will be working on that task until I think it's completed.
## How I will be splitting up work on the largest feature in 0.4

The largest feature that will be added in 0.4 is the completely remade chapter 1 level, aiming to be around 30 minutes long. I have thought of an idea that I think will allow me to work on the chapter faster. From now on, any work on Chapter 1 will be split into **sections**. Before starting any work on the level at all, I will split up work on the chapter into different sections and only focus on assets, code, etc. on the section I am working on. A genius plan for sure!

As you can see, I have also made a separate tab for any tasks that I think should be done AFTER the main tasks are completed (Ones that I think may take way too much time in this development cycle)
# The end of log 1.5

Since this is a shorter log meant to follow up on a previous issue in log 1, I have decided to name this log 1.5. I will write log 2 when the New UI is completed!
