# Introduction

I can guarantee that a lot of people this year will be doing something related to game development, but I am to blow all of them out of the water. A bold claim, but I will do everything in my power to make the statement true. 

The goal for my capstone project is to create a major update (Version 0.4) for my in-development video game (Titled ["Mission: Monkey"](https://github.com/lemons-studios/mission-monkey)). For this update (And the entirety of the project), I will be creating any and all assets/code for the game (with the exception of music because I am not good with music software, I have a friend that has some music that I'm allowed to use). No prebuilt models and/or scripts in this project, everything will be created by yours truly (with the assistance of online forums whenever I encounter problems in my code)

After the completion of this project, I hope to become an even better computer programmer and 3d modeler compared to before the completion of the project. any and all progress and learning will be documented in these logs or in separate notes

# What Is Mission: Monkey?

Mission: Monkey is a singleplayer first-person shooter (Made with Unity) in development by me and a small team that periodically helps with the project (As mentioned above, I will be doing nearly all the legwork for this project though). We have decided to brand this team as ["Lemon Studios"](https://lemon-studios.ca), named after the famous ["incendiary lemons" quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt6iTwVIiMM) from "Portal 2", one of the greatest video games ever created. 

In this game, the player will be playing as a monkey attempting to destroy a massive monopoly that has total control over the solar system, With each chapter of the game taking place on a different celestial body in the solar system (With the exception of the first chapter). I will elaborate more later 
# The plan for this update

This update is absolutely gargantuan and absolutely ambitious too. I will essentially be remaking the game from scratch to meet my standards for this game, because right now, it is absolutely lacking. 

A rough feature list of this update will be:
- A complete remake of chapter 1 (With an attempt at making it around 20-30 minutes long)
- New movement mechanics
- Save/Load system
- A massive amount of completely new and fully-animated 3d models
- A fully-rigged and animated Player model
- Completely new (And smart) AI enemies 
- All New UI (User Interface)
- Post-Processing effects (To make the game stick out compared to the rest of them)
- Optimised Performance & Better graphics settings

Do I think i can do this in about 6 months? probably, but being pessimistic about it won't help whatsoever. I will attempt to finish everything. If I can't, I will finish everything to as far as I can take it before capstone presentation day, but I am optimistic. I will literally throw away my social life to make this happen

# What has been done as of now

As of this log, I have created the skeleton of the new player controller (Which is needed for the new movement mechanics), and I have created a basic implementation of the save/load system, which I recently realised may need a little overhaul if I don't want my code to be messy, And am currently creating the brand new UIs for the game (which may take a while since I am a programmer first and UI designer last). I have drafted plans for some of the new UI for the game, and hope to finish it within a few weeks after finishing the creation of this log.

# The biggest problem I currently face

The biggest problem I have with this project right now is that my ideas are not organised whatsoever. I plan on fixing this somehow, and am looking into solutions for my problem. On log 2, I hope to talk about my solution for organising everything.

Some solutions I have thought of include task/checklist software such as Microsoft to-do, but I feel like I need something more sophisticated to keep track of my ideas for this project. I do know that this obsidian vault will be the home for all of my notes, but I still need to figure out how to keep track of all the tasks for this project 
# The end of log 1

The key takeaways from this log is that I am hopeful for the future of this project and I am already making some progress on this update. That's it.
